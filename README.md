## Backend

```
cd server && nodemon dev
```

Server is running on http://localhost:5000

## Frontend

```
cd client && npm run serve
```

App is running on http://localhost:8080

## Deploy

I have integrated the frontend and tried with serverless framework but this is currently not working as expected.

```
serverless deploy
```
